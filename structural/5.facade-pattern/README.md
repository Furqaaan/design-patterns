The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes or APIs.

Think of it like the front desk at a hotel — you don’t talk to housekeeping, kitchen, or maintenance directly;
you just call the front desk, and they handle everything behind the scenes.

Simplifies complex subsystems behind one easy-to-use interface.
✅ Reduces coupling — client code doesn’t depend on internal classes.
✅ Makes code cleaner and easier to maintain.
✅ You can change internal implementations without breaking anything outside.

Use the Facade Pattern when you want to simplify access to a group of complex subsystems by exposing a single, easy-to-use interface.
