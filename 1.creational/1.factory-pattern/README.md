The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that:

-Provides a central place (factory) to create objects.
-Hides the instantiation logic from the client (controller).
-Lets you add new types without modifying client code.

👉 In simple words:
Instead of writing new Something() everywhere, you let the factory decide which object to return.


👉 Whenever you find yourself writing if / else or switch just to decide which object to instantiate, move that logic into a Factory.

Example in plain words

Without factory (controller doing too much):

if ($type === 'sms') {
    $notifier = new SmsNotifier();
} elseif ($type === 'email') {
    $notifier = new EmailNotifier();
} elseif ($type === 'slack') {
    $notifier = new SlackNotifier();
}


With factory (controller delegates responsibility):
$notifier = NotificationFactory::make($type);


Now the controller doesn’t need to know which class or how it’s created.
It just asks the factory: “Give me the right object for this case.”


🧠 General Rule of Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is most useful when:
You have a fixed but small set of possible classes (say 2–10).
Each class implements a common interface (so client code can use them interchangeably).
Which class to use depends on some condition (like user input, config, or environment).

👉 Example:

Notification → could be EmailNotifier, SmsNotifier, SlackNotifier.
Payment → could be PayPalPayment, StripePayment, RazorpayPayment.
Shipping → could be DHL, DPD, FedEx.
These are typically not dynamic from DB, but fixed “strategies” that differ in how they work.
